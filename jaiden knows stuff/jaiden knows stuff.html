            <h2>But Why?</h2>
            <p>
                Well, I know a lot about some random stuff, so let's 
                share.
            </p>

            <h3>Haitian Creole</h3>
            <p>
                I did a lil research project on the language 
                and it's pretty nifty. Sounds like French, but the 
                spelling actually makes sense. Its grammar from 
                various West African languages distinguishes it from 
                French too.
            </p>
            <h3>Scheele's Green</h3>
            <p>
                That scince fest project I did last year 
                where I made an 1870s dress from scratch? 
                Just for funsies? Yep.
            </p>
            <h3>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</h3>
            <p>
                Seemingly everlasting hyperfixation. Jojo's is 
                always lurking somehwere in the back of my 
                mind, ready to spring forth with a cringey joke 
                or reference to annoy my friends and family.
